# Development

Use Apple Silicon with macOS 26.4+, Xcode 26 or newer, Python 3.12–3.14,
and a Metal 4 compiler with `uint4b_format` tensor support.
The macOS 26.2 SDK can compile the host code, but Xcode 26.2's default Metal
component cannot compile the kernels; select a newer Metal toolchain when
using that SDK. Packaged users need none of these development tools.

## Build and run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/incoai/splash.git
cd splash
make -j4
./splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit
```

`--model` names an upstream Hugging Face model: an MLX affine 4-bit, group-64
repository such as `mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit`, or a GGUF repository and
variant, `OWNER/REPO:VARIANT`, such as `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M`.
Splash identifies the model from its own metadata and pairs the DFlash2 draft
trained for it. The first serve sets up Python dependencies, downloads the
model and its draft, and prepares the weights once
([Weight preparation](#weight-preparation)); each start follows the model's
revision ([Revisions](#revisions)). Legacy Splash packages remain loadable
([Legacy Splash packages](#legacy-splash-packages)). Public repositories need
no login; private or gated ones need `HF_TOKEN` or `hf auth login`. Ctrl+C
stops serving; stop before upgrading.

Use `--max-context 100K` or `--max-memory 28G` to set optional limits. Memory
limits cap Metal allocations, not combined process RSS. Agents must already be
installed; `./splash claude|opencode|codex|hermes` connects to the running server.
Arguments pass through, for example `./splash codex resume --last`.

Set `SPLASH_API_KEY` in the server and agent shells to require authentication;
`serve --api-key KEY` overrides the server's environment value. API requests
then require `Authorization: Bearer KEY` (or Anthropic's `x-api-key`). Health
and readiness probes and the chat page remain public; enter the key in the
chat page to send requests. The page does not persist the key. Use
`serve --no-webui` to disable the page. Authentication is off by default.

HTTP request bodies are limited to 128 MiB; `serve --max-request-size 256M`
overrides this. Concurrent input bytes share a budget of at least 512 MiB
(or twice the request limit), including retained generation inputs. This is
an input-byte budget, not a process RSS limit: large ASCII/base64 strings can
use roughly twice their encoded size during JSON parsing alone. Decoded images
and object-heavy JSON need additional memory. Oversized requests return 413;
exhausted ingress capacity returns 503. Image and model context limits apply
independently.
Stored Responses history is charged before decoding. Uploads allow 30 seconds
of inactivity; total upload time is limited to 30 seconds plus the body size
at 512 KiB/s (286 seconds for 128 MiB), capped by the overall request deadline.
Timed-out uploads return 408 and release their input reservation.
`/status` reports `http.request_body_bytes` and `http.max_request_bytes`.

Source `install/completions/splash.bash` for Bash or
`install/completions/_splash` for Zsh after `compinit`. Completion suggests
commands, bundled official model IDs and installed models without network access.

## Server configuration

The default listener is `127.0.0.1:8000`. To accept LAN connections:

```sh
splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit --host 0.0.0.0 --api-key YOUR_KEY
```

Connect to the server's LAN IP. `--host` selects the IPv4 bind address;
`--allowed-host NAME` accepts an additional HTTP Host name, such as a custom DNS
name or proxy hostname. It does not change the listener or allowlist client IPs.

Use `--port 8001` or set `SPLASH_PORT=8001` to select another port. Set the same
`SPLASH_PORT` in the local agent shell. Separate ports allow separate servers;
their memory limits are independent. The packaged agent launchers connect to
loopback, so use a listener that includes loopback when launching agents locally.

## API model aliases

Repeat `--served-model-name NAME` to accept additional API model IDs. The full
`--model` ID still selects the model. `/v1/models` lists that ID first, followed
by unique aliases; each alias's `root` identifies the loaded model. Generation
and scoring responses always report the real model ID, even when requested
through an alias. The model list and lookup support both names.

```sh
splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit --served-model-name local-qwen
```

Aliases cannot contain whitespace, control characters, `\`, `%`, `?`, `#`,
or empty, `.` or `..` path segments. This keeps model discovery URLs unambiguous.

## Default reasoning effort

`--default-reasoning-effort` (or `SPLASH_DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT`) sets the
fallback for Chat `reasoning_effort` and Responses `reasoning.effort` when absent
or null. Accepted values: `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`,
`max`. An explicit request value wins; the CLI flag takes precedence over the
environment. Unset, the model's template default is unchanged. Effort names are
passed to the template using the same mapping as per-request values, not token
budgets.

```sh
splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit --default-reasoning-effort none
```

`/apply-template` uses the same default. Anthropic `thinking` keeps its protocol
semantics (off when omitted); judgment endpoints always disable thinking.

## Upstream model loading

`install/upstream.py` installs a model from its upstream repository: it
inspects the target, pairs the draft trained for it and decides when to follow
the Hub. The result is an assembly, a local directory of links to the sources'
Hub snapshots, published atomically. The other installer modules each own one
part: `hub.py` the sources, the Hub cache and its pins; `assembly.py` the
assembly layout, its build, verification and garbage collection, and the
metadata derived from a GGUF; `families.py` the registry; `legacy.py` Splash
packages; and `models.py` model IDs, selections, the installation lock and the
command line (`install/models.py --model ID prepare|verify`). The assembly's
`model.json` records the resolved sources and selected formats. The native
loader reads it, and `splash serve`, `test-http-real` and the HTTP regression
benchmark hold it while they run, so a concurrent installation cannot collect
the assembly they serve. It is local installation metadata, not a file model
publishers supply.

A target is identified by its own metadata: an MLX config's `text_config`, or
the one `gguf.model_config` derives from the selected GGUF's header, read with a
few HTTP range requests before any weight download. The registry
(`families.FAMILIES`) states each supported architecture's signature and the
draft trained for it; repository names and model-card `base_model` fields play
no part. An MLX target must declare affine 4-bit, group-64 `quantization` in
`config.json`. Native source adapters validate model geometry, quantization,
tensor shapes and draft compatibility again before execution. Remote Python
code is not loaded.

```bash
splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit
splash serve --model unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M
splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit --language-only
```

A model ID with `--revision`, `--language-only` or `--draft-model` is a
separate installation from the same ID without them.

### Revisions

Installation resolves each source's revision to a commit once, downloads by
that commit and records it in `model.json`, so a repository update cannot mix
files from different revisions. It pins those snapshots in the Hub cache
(`refs/splash/<installation>/<commit>`), so pruning the cache cannot remove files
an installed model links.

Every start resolves the target's revision (the default branch, or
`--revision`) with one Hub request of at most 5 seconds (`hub.HUB_TIMEOUT`);
`hub.Repository.resolve` alone decides whether the Hub is asked:

- The installed commit: the assembly's links, sizes and times are checked and
  it starts. It is re-assembled first when this release pins another draft for
  the family or changed the GGUF metadata adapter; if that draft cannot be
  fetched, the installed one is kept.
- A new commit: only changed files are downloaded, and the new assembly
  replaces the installed one atomically once published.
- No answer, or a new commit that cannot be installed: the installed model
  starts, with one line naming the Hub's reason or, on stderr, the
  installation attempt that failed.
- A 40-hex `--revision` never moves and `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` forbids the Hub:
  both start a verified installation without a request.

There is no update flag; to stay on one commit, pass it as `--revision`. A
missing assembly, or one that no longer verifies, is built again. Without the
Hub it is built from a cached snapshot, of the commit the `--revision` names,
or else the one the installation recorded or pinned, or one the Hub cache
records for the branch, never of another revision. Only files downloaded before
are available, which is enough to rebuild a damaged or deleted assembly. The
installer never rewrites upstream files.

### Model cache

To download new models to another disk, set the cache location before serving:

```sh
HF_HUB_CACHE=/Volumes/Models/huggingface splash serve --model mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit
```

`HF_HUB_CACHE` selects the Hugging Face download cache. Alternatively, set
`HF_HOME` to relocate the Hugging Face home directory, including its default
`hub` cache. Model links and agent sessions stay in Splash's data directory;
existing downloads are not moved. Prepared weights have their own cache,
which this does not move ([Weight preparation](#weight-preparation)).

### Draft assets

Splash's DFlash2 drafts share one Hub repository, `families.DRAFTS`, with a
folder per base model named after it: `Qwen3.8-27B/` and `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B/`.
Each folder holds `config.json`, `model.bin` and `layer-N.bin`. The
configuration is the original DFlash2 configuration with
`splash.format = "MDFD0004"` and `splash.source`, the DFlash2 checkpoint the
weights came from; native loading validates it against the target. The weights
are the verified Q4 drafts of the Splash packages, not a quantization made at
startup. Each family pins the commit that published its folder
(`Draft.revision` in `families.FAMILIES`), and installation downloads only that
folder.

To prepare a folder from a verified existing package:

```bash
python dev/tools/export_draft.py PACKAGE ORIGINAL_DRAFT_CONFIG DRAFTS/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
```

The exporter verifies existing artifact hashes and copies only draft files.
`--draft-model` accepts such a folder, a local copy of the whole repository, or
another Hub repository with the same layout.

### Tokenizer and chat templates

An MLX target's configuration, tokenizer files and chat template come from its
resolved snapshot. For GGUF, `install/gguf.py` reads the selected file's
metadata without mapping or decoding weight tensors. Vocabulary IDs, BPE merge
ranks, control/user-defined token types, BOS/EOS/padding IDs and template text
come from that file; the supported `gpt2/qwen35` profile supplies the NFC and
byte-level pre-tokenization algorithms. Unknown profiles, malformed metadata
and automatic BOS/EOS insertion are rejected, with no cross-repository
fallback; GGUF sidecar tokenizer/config files do not override embedded metadata.
Model geometry is translated from the same metadata, subtracting any declared
MTP layers from the layer count. Only the header is read before the download.
The tokenizer and configuration are derived from the downloaded file once and
cached under `models/.metadata`, keyed by the source files' content, `gguf.py`
and the `tokenizers` version; publication is atomic and entries are hash-checked
on use.

Request preparation merges the leading system and developer messages into one
system message, joined by a blank line: Responses instructions and developer
items, or an Anthropic `system` and a leading system message. A system message
after that, as agent clients send when they change instructions during a
conversation, renders where it occurs as a system turn in the template's own
markup.

`server/chat_templates.py` probes each of the tokenizer's templates, including
each named variant such as `tool_use`, once at startup, right after the
tokenizer is validated and before the native runtime starts, so a tokenizer
without a template Splash can serve stops startup before any weights load. The
probe renders a canary conversation whose later system message carries a
marker. Startup logs the outcome (`Chat template · ...`), and `/status` reports
it as `chat_template.later_system`:

- `native`: the marker renders in place; the template is used unchanged.
- `patched`: the template rejects the message (the official Qwen templates
  raise) or drops it (Unsloth's Qwen3.6 GGUF template skips it). Jinja's own
  parser finds the construct responsible: the `raise_exception` in the message
  loop's system branch, or the loop condition that excludes system messages.
  The patch renders the message there with the block the template gives a
  leading system message, and is kept only if ordinary conversations (with and
  without tools, every reasoning effort from `none` to `max`, preserved
  thinking, tool calls and results, images), each rendered as requests render
  it, are byte-identical and the canary renders in place.
- `unsupported`: the template renders the message out of place, has no single
  such construct, renders something before its system block (such as a BOS
  token), or its patch failed a probe. A request with a later system message
  fails with a 400 instead of losing it.

Every request, including image placeholder, token-count and judgment
(`/v1/judgments`, `/v1/systemone`) rendering, uses the template chosen at
startup; tokenizer files and the tokenizer object are unchanged. The probe's
upstream fixtures are in `dev/tests/fixtures/chat_templates/`.

### Vision

Vision comes from the target repository: MLX's `vision_tower.*` tensors,
linking only `config.json` and the shards holding them, or the GGUF
repository's root `mmproj*.gguf` projector, chosen by its header: a `clip`
projector whose weights are BF16, or F32; BF16 is preferred. F16 has a narrower
exponent than BF16, so an F16 projector has already rounded small weights and
is not used. The processor configuration (MLX `preprocessor_config.json`, the
GGUF's `clip.vision` metadata) must describe the one preprocessing Splash
implements (`server/images.py`); it is checked before any weight download and
not installed.

Both sources prepare the packed `vision/model.bin` layout, which the one BF16
vision operator reads: BF16 tensors are copied, and F32 or F16 tensors are
converted under the exact-BF16 rule of [weight preparation](#weight-preparation).
Unsloth's mmproj stores its 1-D tensors, patch embedding and position table as
F32, all of them BF16-exact, and prepares byte-identical to the packed file.
Quantized MLX towers, deepstack projectors and mmproj tensors the tower does not
use are rejected.

`--language-only` links and loads no vision weights and removes them from
memory accounting. It skips a GGUF's mmproj download; MLX vision tensors share
shards with the language model, which download in full. The native Ready event
announces vision only when the model loaded it. Without it, image and PDF input
fails with a 400 naming the modality. Every API shape converts its media to
image and file parts, and message normalization, the one place that accepts or
rejects them, checks before any image is decoded or PDF rendered, in user
turns, tool results and stored Responses history alike. `/status` and
`/v1/models` report `vision: false` and `input_modalities: ["text"]`, and the
launchers configure OpenCode and Hermes without attachments.

### Weight preparation

Source adapters write a model's target and vision tensors into prepared files:
an MLX target and any vision tower into the packed layouts of Splash packages,
which run the same kernels, and a GGUF target into the `MDGG0001` layout of the
GGUF kernels. Each adapter is a loader, which validates the source's metadata
and plans its files, and a writer: `AffineTargetLoader` (`AffineTarget.cpp`)
and `AffinePreparation` for an MLX target, `GgufTargetLoader`
(`GgufTarget.cpp`, planned by `GgufImage.cpp`) and `GgufPreparation` for a GGUF
target, `VisionLoader` and `VisionPreparation` for an MLX or GGUF vision tower.
They open their files through `PreparedFiles`, the `PreparedWeights` cache with
the load's guards. `AffinePreparation` reorders codes, scales and biases into
256-row tiles without requantization and computes GDN decay as
`float(-exp(double(A_log)))`, which may differ by one float ULP in this small
vector from packages produced with MLX's float exponential. `GgufPreparation`
repacks GGUF blocks ([GGUF targets](#gguf-targets)).

Preparation never rounds a weight. A tensor it converts to BF16 (vision tensors
stored as F32 or F16, a GGUF's convolution taps and time-step bias) must be
exactly representable in BF16; otherwise preparation fails, naming the tensor
and, for a vision tensor, its file.

The cache is `~/Library/Caches/Splash/weights`, or the directory
`SPLASH_WEIGHT_CACHE` names; nothing else selects it. It holds an additional
copy of the weights about the model's size, its prepared target and vision
tensors. Preparing needs that much free disk space plus a 2 GiB reserve: before
anything is written, the factory (`ModelFactory.cpp`) constructs the target's
and the vision tower's loaders and checks the space of every missing file they
plan, plus the reserve, once. Uninstalling a model does not
delete possibly shared prepared weights. With Splash stopped, entry directories
can be deleted; deleting the whole cache causes preparation at the next load.

A prepared file's key hashes its adapter's preparation identity, its plan, and
the bytes, type and shape of every source tensor it reads, located and hashed
within its file's tensor data. An edit to a source's metadata only (a GGUF chat
template, a safetensors header), `config.json` or files the component does not
read keeps every key. The preparation identity is a build-generated fingerprint
of only the code that writes the bytes, the files listed per adapter in
`INPUTS` of `dev/tools/weight_preparation_identity.py`; inference, parser,
planner and reader changes keep it. The hashes of the images prepared from the
test fixtures, in `dev/tests/fixtures/weight-goldens/goldens.json`, fail the
tests on any change of prepared bytes. Its README gives the procedure for an
intended change: the key the new bytes need, and the order in which the
independent layout oracles and the hashes are updated.

Each entry records in `source` its component (such as `target/layer-0.bin`),
the digest of the source data it was written from and the source path.
Publishing an entry removes the complete entries it supersedes: the same
component from the same source data under another key, which an earlier
preparation identity wrote, and entries of earlier Splash versions prepared from
the same source path. Entries of other sources or revisions, which
installations may share, stay. Removal happens under the converter lock, so no
entry being written is touched, and a running process keeps the files it has
mapped until it unmaps them. Two builds of different preparation identities
sharing one cache supersede each other's entries at every start; give a
development build its own `SPLASH_WEIGHT_CACHE`.

One writer per cache serializes conversion; complete cache hits bypass this
lock. Each output's disk space is preallocated before writing. Interruption,
disk-full errors and memory-pressure rejection cannot publish partial files;
concurrent external disk activity can still exhaust the volume. Retrying removes
abandoned writes under the converter lock and reuses previously completed
files, which are read-only. Cold preparation reports each artifact's progress.

Cold source hashing and output validation stream bounded buffers. Unchanged
files reuse a digest proof tied to device, inode, size, birth time, mtime and
ctime; a write or replacement invalidates it. This is not a full disk scrub on
every startup. Preparation uses uncached destination I/O. Every adapter sizes
its conversion steps to one staging bound, input and output together, of
32 MiB (`kWeightPreparationStagingBytes`), whatever the tensor, layer or expert
count, inside a 64 MiB admission reserve that also covers source metadata.
Complete rows and multiple row tiles are processed together where possible,
avoiding per-row I/O and small GPU waits. On a cache miss the runtime admits
the conversion workspace (`admitConversion`) before anything is allocated and
again before each chunk; warning/critical memory pressure or inadequate host
headroom stops conversion. Cache hits and bounded source verification use
normal startup admission instead; cancellation and critical pressure still
abort loading.

`WeightFile` maps completed files, prepared or packed, read-only into one
no-copy Metal buffer, so no model-sized anonymous allocation holds the weights.
Runtime admission counts prepared weights, draft and vision exactly once
(`preparedModelWeightBytes`, which `tune-kernels` and the runtime oracle use
too). File
backing does not make Metal-resident pages reclaimable: residency wires them
until released. macOS page cache, driver allocations and other applications
still affect memory pressure and swap.

Operator plans use each projection's physical layout, independently of the source
container. `Projection`, `MoeWeights` and `EmbeddingWeights` represent different
operator contracts. Arena sizing collects each projection's actual layout (a
GGUF target's block projections beside its affine draft's) and reserves the
vocabulary head only for decode.

### GGUF targets

`--model unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M` selects the repository's
root-level GGUF for that variant: the file named with the model name its GGUFs
share, then `-UD-Q4_K_M`, or else the only one whose name ends in `-UD-Q4_K_M`
(`upstream.select_gguf`). Before any weight download, its header must list
every tensor the loader reads with a type it accepts for that tensor
(`gguf.loaded_tensors`, checked by `gguf.require_loadable`; a test holds its
quantized types to `metal/abi/QuantFormat.h`). The native loader checks again
and lists every unsupported tensor in one error:

- linears and experts: Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, Q3_K, IQ4_XS, IQ4_NL, Q8_0 or IQ3_S;
- token embeddings: Q4_K, Q6_K or Q8_0;
- norms, the MoE router and shared-expert gate, and the GDN convolution, decay
  and time-step bias: F32;
- GDN alpha and beta: both Q8_0 or both F32.

Of Unsloth's files in September 2026 that covers, for Qwen3.8-27B, UD-Q4_K_M
and every larger file but Q4_1, UD-Q8_K_XL and BF16, and for Qwen3.6-35B-A3B,
UD-IQ4_XS and every larger file but MXFP4_MOE, UD-Q8_K_XL and BF16. The smaller
files need IQ3_XXS, IQ2, IQ1 or Q2_K kernels and the others Q4_0/Q4_1, MXFP4 or
BF16 ones, which do not exist yet.

At load time the engine validates the GGUF metadata and plans the `MDGG0001`
layout. `GgufPreparation` stages rows in image order on the CPU within the
staging bound, splitting rows wider than it into column chunks, runs the
`gguf_repack` kernel, and writes its planes into a prepared file. Embeddings
and F32 sections use bounded direct copies.

Every tensor keeps its stored format: the F32 norm multipliers, GDN decay, the
MoE router and shared-expert gate, and GDN alpha/beta when a file stores them
as F32 stay F32 and run in fp32, as llama.cpp keeps them (Apple10 prefill
chunks multiply the router and alpha/beta on the neural accelerator as three
bf16 parts per weight that sum to it exactly, so only fp32 accumulation
rounds). The GDN convolution and time-step bias become bf16 under the exact
rule.

Decode runs one of two kernel families, chosen by GPU family in `runtime/ops/LinearGguf.cpp`. On
Apple9 (M3, M4) the register kernels of `runtime/metal/kernels/decode/linear_gguf_sgmatrix.metal`
feed the codes themselves to bf16 matrix operations with one fp32 epilogue per coefficient
group, so every output is the bf16 rounding of its fp32-accumulated sum. On Apple10 (M5) the
staged kernels of `runtime/metal/kernels/shared/gguf_linear.metal` dequantize each weight once
to half in threadgroup memory for MPP `matmul2d`, the neural accelerator's path; a step of three
request lanes runs the 32-row tile over four lanes of storage. Prefill runs the staged kernels
on both families, chunks of up to 32 rows on the decode tiles. Every projection splits its K
across threadgroups by one rule (`decodeSplits`: each tile's tiers of threadgroups per core and
inputs per partition, from measured occupancy) that does not depend on the batch width. The MoE
experts (`runtime/ops/MoE.cpp`) run the same numerics per family over the grouped rows. These
plans are fixed rules of GPU family, core count and shape; they read no tuned choice. The ABIs
are in `runtime/metal/abi/Gguf.h` and `MoE.h`, the image formats in
`runtime/metal/abi/QuantFormat.h`, their decoding in `runtime/metal/kernels/common/quant_formats.h`;
weight preparation's repack ABI is `runtime/metal/abi/GgufRepack.h`.

The tests' CPU reference (`dev/tests/engine/GgufFormatReference.hpp`) must reproduce the golden
hashes of upstream GGML's dequantization (llama.cpp 7ab4ee7) in `gguf-reference`, and
`gguf-planner` checks the planner's plans; both run in `make test-engine-cpu`.
`make test-engine-metal` runs `gguf-preparation`, which checks every format's planes, as the
production executor and its `gguf_repack` kernel prepare them, bitwise against the reference,
the prepared alpha/beta, norm, convolution and router bytes and the golden images; then
`gguf-projection dequant`, the shipped dequantizer, built with the production Metal flags,
against the FP16 rounding of the reference's values, and the projection kernels
(`gguf-projection full`) and the MoE layer in every format (`gguf-moe`) against fp64. The
goldens and how to regenerate them are in `dev/tests/fixtures/weight-goldens/`; with
`SPLASH_GGML_ORACLE=<libggml-base.dylib>`, `gguf-reference` also compares the reference with
GGML directly and prints GGML's hashes.

## Legacy Splash packages

Splash packages, such as `incoai/Qwen3.8-27B-Splash`, are the prebuilt format
that predates upstream loading, and `--model` still accepts them. They contain
`manifest.json`, packed `target/`, `draft/` and `vision/` weights and
`tokenizer/`; the manifest lists artifact paths, sizes and SHA-256 hashes.
Qwen3.8-27B packages use schema 3 / `splash-packed-q4`, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
packages schema 4 / `splash-packed-q4-moe`. Compatible community fine-tunes may
use any nonempty manifest model name. Native loading validates geometry, tensor
sizes, binary headers, tokenizer and target/draft compatibility, and maps the
packed files without preparation. `install/legacy.py` installs a package as a
selection link to its verified Hub snapshot, pinned like an assembly's
sources. An installed package starts without a Hub request. A package has no
variants, so a `:VARIANT` suffix is rejected, and `--revision`,
`--language-only` and `--draft-model` require an upstream model ID.

## Code and API boundaries

- `server/`: OpenAI Chat/Responses, Anthropic Messages/count_tokens, typed
  judgments, templates, streaming and input processing. No client-version branches.
- `runtime/engine/`: scheduling, memory admission and reusable request state.
- `runtime/model/`: target/draft execution and vision.
- `runtime/ops/` and `runtime/metal/`: operators and Metal kernels.
- `install/`: launcher, client configuration and model installation.
- `dev/`: maintained tests, benchmarks and build/release tools.

Within `server/`, `server.py` owns HTTP and startup; `frontend.py` prepares
requests and history; `backend.py` owns native request lifecycles. `judgments.py`
owns finite-choice prompts, validation and typed answer math. `output.py` parses
generated text for both streaming and complete responses, and `constraints.py`
compiles token constraints. `make architecture-check` prevents lower layers from
importing the HTTP entry module.

Tools can be combined with structured answers. Tool argument framing resolves
local references and projects object fields through schema composition. The
original schema validates complete arguments, including cross-field conditions,
dependencies and property-count rules that framing alone cannot enforce. Extra
properties use JSON-encoded values; statically typed strings retain raw text.
Remote schema references and parameter names containing XML delimiters are
unsupported. Hosted search is unsupported; configure client-owned tools such as
MCP. Omitted effort uses the model default.
`response_format` constrains generation and validates final output; it does not
inject formatting instructions into the prompt. Clients should describe their
output requirements in their own messages.
Hidden thinking signatures use a persistent user key; imported encrypted thinking
preserves visible history without recovering the private reasoning.

`/status.admission` distinguishes memory and concurrency waits, reports suspended
requests, recovery draining and the oldest current wait age. Memory transitions
also appear in the console. Warning pressure can pause growth while `/ready`
remains healthy for work that fits existing allocations.

PDF input supports base64 documents within a shared 64 MiB source/rendering
budget and the native 64-image limit (one image per page). Model context and
isolated rendering limits also apply. URL inputs, opening passwords and citations
are unsupported.
Responses automatic truncation and unsupported history edits return errors.

`POST /tokenize` accepts `{"content":"hello","add_special":false}` and returns
`{"tokens":[...]}` using the loaded tokenizer. Special-token strings are recognized;
`parse_special:false` and `with_pieces:true` are unsupported.
`POST /apply-template` accepts Chat-style `messages`, `tools` and reasoning options,
and returns `{"prompt":"..."}` using the same template as generation.
`add_generation_prompt` defaults to true. Image prompts retain textual placeholders;
raw tokenization does not account for image embeddings (use `count_tokens` for that).
Both endpoints run without inference and share bounded preparation capacity with
`count_tokens`; they can inspect prompts larger than the serving context limit.

Streaming requests accept `"return_progress":true` (default false). Before output,
`prompt_progress` reports `{total, cache, processed, time_ms}`: prompt tokens,
initial cached tokens, completed tokens including cache, and elapsed milliseconds
since prefill admission. Updates follow completed chunks and never regress during
recovery; they are not a time estimate. Chat uses empty-delta chunks, Responses
uses `response.in_progress`, and Messages uses `ping`. Queueing and prompt
preparation do not advance this counter. Non-streaming requests cannot enable it.

`GET /status` returns instance identity and the effective context limit as JSON.
Proxy consumers can use these fields; additional fields may be added:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `requests.submitted`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `failed` | Native request counters since engine start |
| `memory_actual.current_bytes`, `peak_bytes` | Metal allocations, not process RSS |
| `metrics.decode_tokens_per_second` | Aggregate native decode throughput, not a request's end-to-end rate |
| `maximum_context_tokens` | Declared context limit; available memory may limit admission |
| `vision`, `input_modalities` | Whether image and PDF input is accepted; `false` and `["text"]` after `--language-only` |
| `chat_template.later_system` | `native`, `patched` or `unsupported`: how system messages after the first render (per name for named templates) |

`GET /metrics` exposes the same counters in Prometheus text format. Both endpoints
require the API key when authentication is enabled. Consumers should tolerate
missing native fields while the engine is unavailable, and counter resets after
an engine restart. Chat streams include token usage when the request sets
`"stream_options":{"include_usage":true}`; non-streaming Chat responses always
include usage. A proxy must consume these fields to display statistics.

Chat completions also include a llama-server-style `timings` object, both in
non-streaming responses and in the final finish-reason chunk of a stream,
even without `include_usage`. `prompt_n` and `predicted_n` are the full prompt
and output counts; `cache_n` is the cached prompt count. `prompt_ms` measures
native start to first emission, and `predicted_ms` measures first emission to
completion. These elapsed intervals exclude the initial admission queue and
are not isolated GPU timings. `prompt_per_second` uses only uncached prompt
tokens; `predicted_per_second` excludes the entire first emission (which can
contain multiple speculative tokens). Thus rates use tokens processed in the
measured interval, not the full counts. An unavailable rate is zero, including
responses completed in one emission. Per-request draft counters are omitted
because the native runtime only reports them at batch level.

`/metrics` also exports fixed latency histograms in seconds, with a bounded
set of stages in `/status.latency`. HTTP duration includes body upload and
response writing for admitted API requests. Preparation, queue, template,
tokenization, output grammar preparation and image preparation are measured
separately; preparation includes its nested stages. Tokenization covers the encoding call, including reuse when
available. Histogram buckets are cumulative and labeled by upper bound.
TTFT starts before upload and ends at the first native token
event. Output intervals are between native token events, which can contain
multiple speculative tokens; they are not per-token latency. Native queue timing
is recorded from successful completions. These histograms live with the HTTP
process and survive a native engine restart.

HTTP bodies require Content-Length, and browser
Origin must match Host. `--allowed-host` permits additional hostnames. Request
logs omit bodies; full crash traces require explicit `SPLASH_CRASH_TRACE=1` and
can contain private conversation data.

Requests sharing a cold prefix can wait for a resident request's planned recovery
point, then enter through the ordinary cache restore path. Waiting requests hold
no active state cell or KV pages and return to ordinary admission when no useful
producer remains. Late arrivals can extend the plan at complete state boundaries.
Higher-priority work does not wait for a lower-priority producer. `/status` exposes
`scheduler.waiting_prefix` separately from resource waits.

Greedy and sampled requests can share an unconstrained decode batch; each lane
keeps its own sampling policy and RNG. Pure greedy batches retain their argmax
path. Constrained requests use a separate batch for the host mask exchange.

Long prefill uses disposable rolling checkpoints every 4096 tokens. Contended
prefill adapts toward a 500 ms slice, keeping 2048-token chunks for long unopposed
work. These policies do not extend client deadlines. Memory recovery waits are
bounded, but readiness does not guarantee that a request-sized allocation fits.

### Judgment contracts

`POST /v1/systemone` accepts the [TypeSafe System One](https://docs.typesafe.ai/)
request and response shapes: `noul`, `choice` and `score` questions over a shared
state. It works with the official `typesafe-sdk` (verified with 0.7.0). Use the
actual served model ID, not a hosted Jev model name; `/v1/models` answers both
OpenAI model discovery and the SDK's `models.list()`.

```python
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, Noul, Score, TypeSafeClient

with TypeSafeClient(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000",
    api_key="local",  # Use SPLASH_API_KEY's value if server authentication is on.
    model="mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit",
) as client:
    result = client.system_one(
        state={"message": "I was charged twice. Please fix this today."},
        questions={
            "billing": Noul(instructions="Is this about billing?"),
            "department": Choice(
                instructions="Which team should handle this?",
                criteria={"billing": None, "technical": None, "sales": None},
            ),
            "urgency": Score(
                instructions="How urgent is the request?",
                criteria=["No urgency", "This week", "Today"],
            ),
        },
    )
    print(result.choices["department"].choice)
```

`POST /v1/judgments` scores one [SemIf](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf) row of
2–16 options and returns raw option logits:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/judgments \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "id": "approval",
    "state": "The proposal is awaiting approval.",
    "question": "What is the current approval status?",
    "options": [
      {"id": "approved", "description": "Approval was explicitly given."},
      {"id": "pending", "description": "Approval has not been given."}
    ]
  }'
```

`POST /v1/judgments` preserves SemIf's `direct-options-v1` JSON serialization,
system prompt and A–P option order. It returns the exact rendered prompt's SHA-256,
answer token IDs, raw option logits, normalized probabilities and zero completion
tokens. Every answer label must round-trip as one token, including at the actual
assistant prompt boundary. Unsupported generation controls return errors rather
than silently changing the scoring protocol. SemIf-derived code retains its MIT
notice in `server/judgments.py`.

`POST /v1/systemone` requires the served `model`, a string/object/array `state`,
and a nonempty `questions` map. Instructions may be omitted, null or structured;
criteria descriptions may also be structured. Noul criteria may be omitted.
Choice and score domains contain 1–255 entries. Singletons return their sole
answer without inference. Other domains use deterministic, distinct single-token
slots selected from the tokenizer. All questions are validated before any inference.
A request holds at most 64 questions and 1M total prepared prompt tokens;
larger batches are rejected before any inference.
Questions run sequentially within a request under one shared deadline, allowing
prefix reuse without filling the admission queue; independent HTTP requests still
share the scheduler. Disconnects and timeouts cancel the current question.

Preparation renders each prompt once, then enforces the context limit and the
batch token budget before the per-slot boundary checks, which re-tokenize the
prompt once per option. Those checks also observe the request deadline, so an
oversized or expired request is rejected without paying for every option.
Prompts that exceed the context limit are rejected, not truncated.

System One validation uses 422 `detail` arrays; successful responses contain
`model`, `answers`, and `usage`, plus an `x-typesafe-request-id` header. SDK model
discovery reports an empty `release_date` because Splash records none for a model.
The official SDK is a client only, not a server dependency. API compatibility does
not imply Jev weights, accuracy, proprietary confidence semantics or calibration.

These are local model scores, not calibrated confidence. Probabilities are a
softmax over the declared answer slots. Choice/score `confidence` is normalized
entropy concentration, `1 - H(p) / log(K)`, not an estimate of correctness.
Score answers are probability-weighted level indices. Measure accuracy and
calibrate on representative held-out data before using decision thresholds.

Native wire version 6 appends score-token IDs to requests and selected f32 logits
to Done events; a version mismatch is fatal. Scoring requires 2–255 distinct,
in-vocabulary tokens, no images or generation constraints, and a zero output budget.
It may use the full context window because no generated token needs a reserved
position. The final prefill chunk runs the target head but no sampling policy or
DFlash decode. Successful scoring emits no Tokens event, finishes with Stop, and
reports zero decode time. Cancelled requests carry no logits.

A non-finite score logit is a per-request failure, not an engine fault: the
engine reports `model_result_invalid` for that request alone, before it
publishes the failing step's cache state or any output, and the rest of the
batch finishes normally. Prompt chunks that already succeeded keep the blocks
they committed, exactly as they do for a cancelled request. GPU faults and
broken engine invariants stay fatal and still mark the runtime unhealthy.

## Validate

```sh
make check
make install test-real test-http-real MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit
```

`make check` needs no model weights. `make check-native-cpu` builds production
and runs native CPU tests without a GPU; `make check-native-metal` requires a
supported Metal device and runs the kernel tests under shader validation.
Hosted CI runs CPU checks and sanitizers.

The model targets take `MODEL`, a model ID installed in this checkout's
`install/models` by `make install MODEL=...`:

| Target | Checks | Models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test-real` | vision parity with the family's fixture in `dev/tests/fixtures/vision-parity/`, and the native runtime oracle | MLX, GGUF, packages |
| `test-http-real`, `test-release-real` | real HTTP, and with `test-release-real` the four agent clients | MLX, packages |
| `test-performance-real`, `benchmark-backend`, `benchmark-decode-profile`, `tune-kernels` | native measurements of the installed model | MLX, GGUF, packages |

`dev/tests/smoke_real.py` and `dev/tests/agent_real.py`, which the HTTP and
client targets run, do not accept a GGUF `:VARIANT` yet. Repeat the model tests
with `MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit`. GGUF targets run their own
projection and MoE kernels, which `make check` covers on synthetic tensors
only: when those kernels or their preparation change, also run
`make install test-real test-performance-real` with
`MODEL=unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M` and
`MODEL=unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M`.

Before release, install all four agents and run `make release-check MODEL=...`
for both MLX models from a clean checkout. It includes correctness, sanitizers,
real HTTP/client behavior and performance characterization, and takes no GGUF
model. The hardware release gate (`release-hardware` in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs it on self-hosted Macs for the two Splash
packages, which load the packed files directly: it exercises neither MLX
preparation nor GGUF.

`make all build/engine-tests/affine-source-oracle` builds the affine source oracle, which
no target runs; pass it `build/splash.metallib`, an installed MLX model's `target`
directory and the matching installed package to compare every prepared byte.

Compare performance on the same idle Mac with the same model and workload.
`make tune-kernels MODEL=...` measures the precompiled kernel candidates for the
installed model on this Mac against the policy defaults in `runtime/ops` and
reports every key where one wins; it changes no default and saves no profile.
For a GGUF model it measures the attention kernels and the affine draft's
projections only, since GGUF projection and MoE plans read no tuned choice
([GGUF targets](#gguf-targets)). Keep generated reports, profiles, local paths
and experiment notes out of the source tree and commits.

### Local benchmarks

From a source checkout with the model installed, use the native benchmark for
prefill, decode and batch measurements:

```sh
make test-performance-real MODEL=mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit
```

It writes `build/release/backend-benchmark.json`. Repeat with the 35B model and,
for the GGUF kernels, a GGUF of each family. This characterizes one build; it
is not a comparison with another engine or a test of agent task quality.

For a same-machine HTTP regression check, retain the previous `splash` binary
**and its adjacent `splash.metallib`**, then run from the candidate checkout:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m dev.benchmarks.http_regression \
  --model unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_M \
  --baseline-binary /path/to/baseline/build/splash \
  --contexts 2048,10000 --samples 5
```

It needs an installed Splash package: it checks the package's `manifest.json`.
It starts isolated servers in alternating order, compares matched cold,
exact-prefix and decode requests, and saves `build/release/http-regression.json`.
It does not contact your running server. Use the same power mode and charger,
stop other GPU workloads, and report chip/GPU cores, memory, Splash version,
model revision, actual input/output token counts, and cache hits with results.
Keep cold prefill, cached TTFT and sustained decode separate; a UI token rate
alone does not measure end-to-end agent performance.

For slow tool-bearing requests, the `latency` section of `/status` separates
preparation, tokenization, grammar preparation, native queueing and TTFT. Grammar preparation
includes construction, compilation/cache lookup and per-request cloning;
it does not include generation-time masks. The `grammar_cache` counters show
whether compiled output grammars are reused. Tool definitions still contribute
tokens to the prompt; saving their JSON alone cannot avoid model prefill.
Existing exact-prefix caching reuses model work while the server remains alive.
Text requests also reuse tokenized history at literal message-end boundaries
when the tokenizer supports independent encoding there. This process-local
cache retains at most four prefixes and 8 MiB of text/token storage; it falls
back to full encoding for other tokenizer pipelines. `/status.tokenizer_cache`
reports its usage. It does not alter prompt text, token IDs or the GPU KV cache.
Server restarts require recomputation. The separate
[SSD cache proposal](https://github.com/incoai/splash/pull/3) preserves evicted
model state during a server session; its temporary files do not survive shutdown.

## Package

Release archives contain no Hugging Face credentials and use the official model
list committed with the source. The model-catalog workflow updates that list
from the official collection independently of packaging.
Users accessing private models supply their own `HF_TOKEN` or Hugging Face login.

Release versions are three-part, `x.y.z`, with no `v` prefix: `1.0.0`, then
`1.0.1` for a fix and `1.1.0` for a feature. Use the same version in all three
commands:

```sh
make package RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
make package-bottle RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
make package-check RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0
```

The archive, checksum, formula and bottle go to `dist/`; these commands do not
publish. Build bottles on the oldest supported macOS. Bottle/check commands use
a temporary tap and remove their installation; they refuse to replace an existing
Splash installation. The install check requires a poured bottle and runs the
bundled launcher without a compiler or separate Python installation.

To publish: create a GitHub Release on the public mirror `incoai/splash` with
the archive, bottle, checksum files and `SHA256SUMS`, then copy `dist/splash.rb`
over `Formula/splash.rb` in `incoai/homebrew-tap`. Both public repositories
hold exactly one squashed commit of this repository's `main`, authored by Jian
Chen with Zhijian Liu as co-author, and are updated by force-push, never by
pull request. Before re-squashing, `main` must contain no references to the internal
or academic mirrors of the model repositories. Then, on a clean machine:
`brew install incoai/tap/splash && splash --help`, and
`brew audit --strict --online incoai/tap/splash`.

The runtime package allowlists engine, Python, server and launcher files; tests,
benchmarks and developer documents are excluded. User model links and Hermes
sessions survive upgrades; downloads remain in the Hugging Face cache.
